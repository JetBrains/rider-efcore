### Features

There are a couple of UI stuff for:
- Creating migrations
- Updating database with selected migration (including migration names autocompletion)
- DbContext scaffolding from existing database
- Creating SQL scripts from the migration range
- Removing last created migration
- Suggesting installing `dotnet ef` command line tools if not installed (when opening solution that contains EF Core related projects)
- Previewing commands before execution
- Persisting selected common preferences between dialogs

### How to install

**Starting from Rider 2023.3, the plugin is bundled into the main Rider distribution. No additional actions required.**

### How to use

1. Open solution that contains EF Core related projects (migrations and startup projects)
2. Navigate to <kbd>Entity Framework Core</kbd> under project or solution context menu:
